                  <p>Through Learn Sync, I wanted to get a deeper understanding of educational technology from a teacherâ€™s point of view. Setting up a sandbox course and creating assignments, as well as grading students provided me with some insights into educational technology from a teacher's point of view.</p>

                    Working independently on this project required me to rely on my perseverance and problem-solving abilities.Learn Sync has prepared me for my future goals by giving me practical experience in data visualization and education technology. I've improved my problem-solving abilities and learned how to plan and execute projects effectively.

                  <p>The project combined the fun of game development with the challenge of incorporating educational elements for kids. Knowing that the game could positively impact young players' learning made the project even more meaningful.</p>

                    The agile environment we worked in was incredibly beneficial. It allowed us to be flexible and adaptable, which was crucial for refining the game based on feedback and making sure everything ran smoothly. Collaborating closely with the team led to a lot of great ideas and improvements throughout the development process.
                    This project was also a great learning opportunity. I got to dive into tools and technologies like Git, Unity, and C#, which broadened my skill set and opened up new possibilities for future projects.

                  <p>Working on the website for the Salt Lake City Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) was a meaningful and enriching project. The goal was to support the organization's mission of promoting equity and social justice for Japanese Americans through education, advocacy, and activism. </p>
                  
                  Keeping the website accessible for older current members while making it visually appealing for a younger target audience required careful planning and thoughtful design choices. This challenge pushed our team to consider different perspectives and tailor the website's features and layout to meet these varied needs.

                <span></span>
                  <p>This project was insightful. I explored different audio features like dancebility related to popularity score in music. While my initial expectation was that these characteristics would lead to higher popularity, the findings offered a different perspective. Among the top 100 songs each year, higher danceability and energy were actually associated with lower popularity. This was a surprising discovery, pointing towards other factors such as lyrics, the artist, or cultural relevance as potentially more significant in determining a song's popularity.</p>

                    Overall, this project was both enlightening and humbling. It served as a reminder that in research, our initial assumptions can sometimes be challenged, leading to unexpected and insightful discoveries.

              <span></span>
              <p>Working on the Chatroom project was a great experience in honing my Java programming skills and gaining a deeper understanding of client-server architecture. The project involved creating a chatroom application that allows users to send messages to one another, either privately or in a broadcast to all users.</p>

              The process of developing the chatroom itself really helped me understand how to handle different user interactions, from broadcasting messages to all users to sending private messages or listing all active users.. It was fun to see how all the different pieces fit together to create a platform for communication.
              Overall, the Chatroom project was an excellent way to apply my Java skills and work with network programming concepts.

              <span></span>
              <p>The project provided an opportunity to combine technical skills with a personal interest, which made the process all the more enjoyable.

                The app itself was designed to help people research and learn about different dog breeds. Building it with SQL and Python offered a chance to work with powerful tools that are key in many data-driven applications. </p>
           
                The backend work, particularly with Python, was also a great opportunity to expand my skills. Building the app's functionality, such as searching for dog breeds and allowing users to add new breeds  provided hands on experience in creating a smooth and interactive user interface that seamlessly connects with the database.
